# Python bisect module

The `bisect` module is a part of the Python Standard Library that provides support for efficient searching and insertion operations on ordered lists. It is implemented using the bisection algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer strategy that repeatedly splits a list in half until the target element is found or it is clear that the element is not present in the list. The bisection algorithm is very efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n) for both search and insertion operations, where n is the size of the list. This makes it much faster than linear search algorithms, which have a time complexity of O(n).

The `bisect` module provides two main functions for searching for the position at which a given element should be inserted in an ordered list to maintain its sorted order: `bisect_left` and `bisect_right`. The `bisect_left` function returns the position of the first occurrence of the element in the list, while the `bisect_right` function returns the position of the last occurrence of the element in the list. These functions take a sorted list and a target element as arguments and return an integer indicating the position at which the element should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

In addition to these two main functions, the `bisect` module also provides two helper functions for inserting an element into a sorted list: `insort_left` and `insort_right`. These functions take a sorted list and an element as arguments and insert the element into the list at the position returned by `bisect_left` or `bisect_right`, respectively. These functions are useful for maintaining the sorted order of a list as new elements are added to it.

Here is an example of how to use the `bisect` module to search for and insert an element into an ordered list:

```python
Copy codeimport bisect

# Create an ordered list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Search for the position of 4 in the list
pos = bisect.bisect_left(lst, 4)
print(pos)  # Output: 3

# Insert the element 6 into the list at the correct position
bisect.insort_left(lst, 6)
print(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In the above example, the `bisect_left` function returns the position of the first occurrence of element 4 in the list, which is 3. The `insort_left` function then inserts element 6 into the list at this position, maintaining the sorted order of the list.

The `bisect` module also provides two additional functions: `bisect_key` and `insort_key`. These functions work in a similar way to `bisect_left`, `bisect_right`, `insort_left`, and `insort_right`, but they allow you to specify a key function that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. This can be useful if you want to use a different criterion for sorting the list than the elements themselves.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```python
import bisect

# Create a list of tuples
lst = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd'), (5, 'e')]

# Define a key function that returns the second element of each tuple
def key_func(x):
  return x[1]

# Search for the position of the tuple (4, 'd') in the list
pos = bisect.bisect_left(lst, (4, 'd'), key=key_func)
```

The `bisect` module provides the following functions:

* `bisect_left(lst, elem, lo=0, hi=len(lst))`: This function searches for the position at which the element `elem` should be inserted in the sorted list `lst` to maintain its sorted order. It returns the position of the first occurrence of `elem` in the list. The optional arguments `lo` and `hi` can be used to specify the range of indices within the list to be searched. The default values of `lo` and `hi` are 0 and `len(lst)`, respectively, which means that the entire list will be searched.
    
* `bisect_right(lst, elem, lo=0, hi=len(lst))`: This function is similar to `bisect_left`, but it returns the position of the last occurrence of `elem` in the list.
    
* `insort_left(lst, elem, lo=0, hi=len(lst))`: This function inserts the element `elem` into the sorted list `lst` at the position returned by `bisect_left`. It returns `None`. The optional arguments `lo` and `hi` can be used to specify the range of indices within the list to be searched. The default values of `lo` and `hi` are 0 and `len(lst)`, respectively, which means that the entire list will be searched.
    
* `insort_right(lst, elem, lo=0, hi=len(lst))`: This function is similar to `insort_left`, but it inserts the element at the position returned by `bisect_right`.
    
* `bisect_key(lst, elem, key=None, lo=0, hi=len(lst))`: This function is similar to `bisect_left`, but it allows you to specify a key function that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. The key function should take an element as input and return a value that can be used for comparison. The key function is applied to each element in the list before the element is compared to `elem`.
    
* `insort_key(lst, elem, key=None, lo=0, hi=len(lst))`: This function is similar to `insort_left`, but it allows you to specify a key function that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. The key function should take an element as input and return a value that can be used for comparison. The key function is applied to each element in the list before the element is compared to `elem`.
